# ![icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suitangi/Minimal-Newtab/master/chrome-extension/icons/icon48.png) Minimal Newtab
This project is a Google Chrome/Firefox Newtab replacement framework that allows for custom defined lists of backgrounds to be loaded into a minimalistic page such that every time a new tab is opened, a random background is loaded.

## Using Your Own Backgrounds
The `background.json` is styled in such a way:

```json
{
  "default": {
    "link": "default-link",
    "metadata1": "metadata1",
    "metadata2": "metadata2"
  },
  "info_title": "title of info",
  "info" : [
    [{
      "name": "metadata1",
      "size": "large"
      },
      {
        "name": "metadata2",
        "size": "medium"
      }],
    [{
      "name": "metadata2",
      "size": "small"
      }]
  ],
  "support_link": "http://yoursupportlink.here",
  "report_embed": "<iframe>HTML embed here</iframe>",
  "sources": [{
      "name": "Name of The Source1",
      "list": [
        { "link": "link1",
        "metadata1": "metadata1",
        "metadata2": "metadata2"
        },
        { "link": "link2",
          "metadata1": "metadata1",
          "metadata2": "metadata2"
        }]
    },
    {
      "name": "Source2",
      "list": [
        { "link": "link4",
        "metadata1": "metadata1",
        "metadata2": "metadata2"
        },
        { "link": "link5",
          "metadata1": "metadata1",
          "metadata2": "metadata2"
        }]
    }
  ]
}
```

The `background.json` name should not be changed and should be in the resources directory.
The menu for choosing sources will be automatically generated. It takes the title from the `name:` field in the json of each `source`.

More details of the `background.json` can be found [here](https://suitangi.github.io/Minimal-Newtab/resources/Background%20JSON).
